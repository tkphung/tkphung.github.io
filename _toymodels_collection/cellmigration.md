Guest lecture for [Professor Jennifer Mitchel's](http://www.jennifermitchel.com) course "Cell Migration in Development and Disease" at Wesleyan University. 

I created an agent-based model in [NetLogo](http://www.netlogoweb.org) simulating single and collective cell migration. A description of the model and example simulations can be found in this respository [github.com/tkphung/cellmigration_ABM](https://github.com/tkphung/cellmigration_ABM).

Try out the simulation in your browser: [Cell Migration Agent-Based Model](cellmigrationABM.html)

Click the "Model Info" drop down menu for a guided tutorial and exploration of the model.
